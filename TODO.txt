- Create Game folder
-Create html and js file
-create canvas
-get canvas context
-set canvas width and height
-remove page margin(set to 0)

CREATE PLAYER 
-Create player constructor method
-create player draw method
-add player image on webpage


MOVE PLAYER

-create update function  to update player velocity on x axis
- create key constant to monitor key press
- create event listener that uses switch to track key press and move player accordingly(key down, key up)
- update player velocity movement in the animate method
-update draw function to position player accordingly on game start and handle player rotation

CREATE PROJECTILE

- Create an projector class
-Since projectile will be fired dynamically pass it through a constructor argument
-set position velocity and radius of projectile
-create draw function in projectile to determine how projectile looks like
-declare const projectiles(empty array)
-update animate function to include projectile Movement
-update keydown event listener to update projectiles array to cater 4 new projectiles when space key is fired

CREATE INVADER

- update image, remove rotation
- update invader position and size

CREATE AND MOVE GRIDS OF PLAYERS
-Create a Grid class. It will have a constructor as well
-Create an array named grid to store multiple grids
-move invader into the constructor
-create rows and columns to be occupied by invaders(I used for loop inside Grid class)
-as you push invaders inside grid remember to adjust invader positioning
-update invader velocity

SPAWN GRID AT INTERVALS
-let  frames = 0
-have grid to respawn every 1000frames


SHOOT INVADER
-this will be done within the grid. We will loop through each projectile for every invader
-projectile should only remove an invader if the bottom of the projectile is more than the bottom of the invader
